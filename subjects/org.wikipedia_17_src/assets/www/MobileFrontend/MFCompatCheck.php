/**
 * This class is intended to track compatibility of functionality in the
 * MobileFrontend extension against different versions of MediaWiki.
 *
 * This is generally useful as MW evolves while MobileFrontend maintains a
 * level of support for older versions, and it will come in particularly handy
 * as MobileFrontend functionality is gradually moved into core.
 *
 * Methods herein are intended to be lightweight, static, and performant. In
 * general, it is preferable to do a version_compare() for functionality,
 * however there are times when that is inappropriate, such as when comparing
 * bleeding edge functionality in core. As core evolves, so to should methods
 * in this class when it becomes possible to adopt version_compare().
 *
 * This class can also serve as an at-a-glance list of compatibility issues
 * and statuses for MobileFrontend.
