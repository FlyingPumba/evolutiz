A Game where the user attempts to contain bouncing lines by drawing horizontal
and vertical lines.  When the balls are sufficiently contained, a new level 
begins with an extra ball added.

History:
While writing this game, I had in mind a game I fondly remembered playing 
years ago.  Recently it was pointed out that this game was in fact JezzBall.
As a result, this game is certainly heavily influenced by JezzBall, though does
not attempt to be a perfect clone.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JezzBall.

Notes: 
- Lines are initiated by vertical and horizontal gestures.  On the emulator,
this can be done by clicking a point, dragging in a vertical or horizontal
direction, and then letting go.
- Vibration obviously won't work on the emulator, but has been tested on 
prototype hardware.

TODO/ideas:
- ability to draw multiple animating lines within the same region
- bonus rounds? maybe a lighting bolt bounces around and if you can hit
 it or contain it, you get faster lines?
- save high scores
