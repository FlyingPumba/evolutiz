For 2.0 (in rough order)
------------------------

Sync with Google Books, and include pref to get login and store token (Using OAuth), etc.

Complete the book data provider abstraction, so that multiple providers (more that Google Books, but start with that) can easily be supported.

See Google Books "bookshelf" which now has read, want to read, rating, review, etc 
(When I started this app, that is *exactly* what I had in mind, and Google Books did not have said features, now they do
-- need to basically rewrite this to just leverage that stuff - maybe even throw out the data model here?)

Book object stores multiple ISBNs now, make sure approp fallbacks are in code where one or other not present.

Buttons (add book, etc) should look better use an image or something.

Profile and performance optimize.

Full tests - with coverage/emma.
