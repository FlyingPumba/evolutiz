0.9: 25 Jan 2012
First release to Android market

* What works:
The application performs basic keyer function well, and when coupled with 
a hardware adapter, will on/off key a rig in either CW or Feld-
Hellscreiber mode. Messages are input on the main screen, can be saved to
and played back from memory slots. These memory slots persist between 
sessions, as do all settings. The menu brings up a help screen and a settings
menu. The settings menu sets a number of parameters for CW, Hell, and cw 
beacon modes. 

What mostly works: 
The beacon mode is not fully up to snuff. The timing
is not precise, and the beacon may not update positional information 
adequately. The straight key mode works, but takes some getting used to due 
to both the relative unresponsiveness of the screen and the difficulty of tapping out
code on an inelastic surface. The phone suppresses some system sounds,
but the menu item does not completely disable all sounds, e.g., phone and 
alarms still work. Ideally, if the android device is connected to a radio, 
these sound sources should be silenced to avoid inadvertently keying the 
rig. For now, consider putting the device in "airplane mode", turning off 
alarms, and so on.

What (we know) doesn't work: The beacon QRSS mode is not hooked up at all
right now. 

The TO DO list: Aside from above issues, the obvious missing feature is 
decoding of morse and Hellscreiber modes. We're working on it.
