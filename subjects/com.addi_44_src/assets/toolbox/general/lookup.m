## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{idx} =} lookup (@var{table}, @var{y})
## Lookup values in a sorted table.  Usually used as a prelude to
## interpolation.
##
## If table is strictly increasing and @code{idx = lookup (table, y)}, then
## @code{table(idx(i)) <= y(i) < table(idx(i+1))} for all @code{y(i)}
## within the table.  If @code{y(i)} is before the table, then 
## @code{idx(i)} is 0. If @code{y(i)} is after the table then
## @code{idx(i)} is @code{table(n)}.
##
## If the table is strictly decreasing, then the tests are reversed.
## There are no guarantees for tables which are non-monotonic or are not
## strictly monotonic.
##
## To get an index value which lies within an interval of the table,
## use:
##
## @example
## idx = lookup (table(2:length(table)-1), y) + 1
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## This expression puts values before the table into the first
## interval, and values after the table into the last interval.
## @end deftypefn

## Changed from binary search to sort.
## Thanks to Kai Habel <kai.habel@gmx.de> for the suggestion.

## TODO: sort-based lookup is significantly slower given a large table
## TODO: and small lookup vector.  This shouldn't be a problem since
## TODO: interpolation (the reason for the table lookup in the first
## TODO: place) usually involves subsampling of an existing table.  The
## TODO: other use of interpolation, looking up values one at a time, is
## TODO: unfortunately significantly slower for large tables.  
## TODO:    sort is order O((lt+lx)*log(lt+lx)) 
## TODO:    search is order O(lx*log(lt))
## TODO: Clearly, search is asymptotically better than sort, but sort
## TODO: is compiled and search is not.  Could support both, or recode
## TODO: search in C++, or assume things are good enough as they stand.
