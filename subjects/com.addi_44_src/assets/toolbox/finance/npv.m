## @deftypefn {Function File} {} npv (@var{r}, @var{p}, @var{i})
## Returns the net present value of a series of irregular (i.e., not
## necessarily identical) payments @var{p} which occur at the ends of @var{n}
## consecutive periods.  @var{r} specifies the one-period interest rates and
## can either be a scalar (constant rates) or a vector of the same
## length as @var{p}.
##
## The optional argument @var{i} may be used to specify an initial
## investment.
##
## Note that the rate @var{r} is specified as a fraction (i.e., 0.05,
## not 5 percent).
