For the record, the total number of feasible runs is 95 with both
types of pruning.

No. of feasible runs in Round 1 = 11
Number of runs that get extended = 7
Number of feasible runs in Round 2 = 18 (first tap is EJECT) + 6
(first tap is not EJECT) * 11 = 84
Total number of feasible runs = 11 + 84 = 95
