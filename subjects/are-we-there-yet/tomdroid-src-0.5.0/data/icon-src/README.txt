List of used Stock-Android Icons:

@android:drawable/menuitem_background
@android:drawable/ic_menu_info_details
@android:drawable/ic_menu_preferences
@android:drawable/ic_menu_share


***IMPORTANT***

Please use Stock-Android icons whenever possible instead of selfmade ones.

You can find this icons in your Android SDK folder: android-sdk-linux_x86/platforms/android-4/data/res/drawable
In the code you refere to them as @android:drawable/<file_name_w/o_extension>

This has several advantages:
 * They 100% fit to the Android Icon Guidlines and Android style
 * They automatically suit all available resolutions, themes and Android versions!
 * We do not have to resize them, when requirements change
 * It's less work for you ;-)
