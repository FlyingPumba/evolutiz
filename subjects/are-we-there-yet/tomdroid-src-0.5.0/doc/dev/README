Tomdroid
========

You need at least SDK Tools r3 in order to build Tomdroid.

BUILDING WITH ECLIPSE
1. Install the Android SDK as described on developer.android.com
2. fire up Eclipse, install and setup the ADT plugin
3. Import the Tomdroid project
4. Eclipse will automaticly build the source (sometimes refresh/clean project helps)
5. either grab the apk from the bin/ dir or use Eclipse to
  "Run As Android Application"

BUILDING WITHOUT ECLIPSE
1. Install the Android SDK as described on developer.android.com
2. cd into the Tomdroid root (where src, libs, etc. is located)
3. Create build.xml and *.properties:
$ android update project -p .
You can now build with:
$ ant debug
and install to a running emulator or a connected device with:
$ ant install
and remove from a running emulator or a connected device with:
$ ant uninstall

TIPS:
To push your own notes into the emulator for testing, use util/sync-tomboy-tomdroid.sh while you have the emulator running.
