## @deftypefn {Function File} {} qderivmat (@var{omega})
## Derivative of a quaternion.
##
## Let Q be a quaternion to transform a vector from a fixed frame to
## a rotating frame.  If the rotating frame is rotating about the 
## [x, y, z] axes at angular rates [wx, wy, wz], then the derivative
## of Q is given by
##
## @example
## Q' = qderivmat (omega) * Q
## @end example
##
## If the passive convention is used (rotate the frame, not the vector),
## then
##
## @example
## Q' = -qderivmat (omega) * Q.
## @end example
## @end deftypefn
