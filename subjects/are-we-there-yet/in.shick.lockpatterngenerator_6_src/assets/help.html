<h1>Lock Pattern Generator</h1>
<h2>Program Help</h2>
<p>
    Lock Pattern Generator is a program for creating random patterns with which
    to lock your Android device.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the screen lock itself is a built-in part of your device!
    Lock Pattern Generator cannot lock your device, and it can't unlock it
    either, it simply suggests patterns for you to use.<br/>
    This means two important things:<br/>
</p>
<p>
    <tt>1.  </tt>Uninstalling Lock Pattern Generator will not turn off the
    screen lock.<br/>
    <tt>2.  </tt>If you lock yourself out of your device, the developer can't
    help you.<br/>
</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
    To start using Lock Pattern Generator, simply press the <tt>Generate</tt>
    button.  A random pattern will appear on the grid.
</p>
<p>
    If you'd like to try the pattern out before using it, simply press the
    <tt>Practice</tt> toggle button.  When the <tt>Practice</tt> toggle is on,
    the pattern will disappear, and you can try and copy it by swiping on the
    grid.  If you enter the pattern correctly, the nodes will glow blue, and if
    you are incorrect, they glow red.<br/>
    While practice mode is on, you can't generate any new patterns.  Press the
    <tt>Practice</tt> toggle again to return to generator mode and continue
    creating new patterns.
</p>
<p>
    Once you've selected a pattern to lock your device with, press the
    <tt>Android Security Settings</tt> button to leave Lock Pattern Generator
    and go straight to your device's system settings.  There, you can set your
    pattern to lock your device.
