android.permission.VIBRATE:
	This permission gets trigerred when the ball hits one of the line drawn by the user.
	This could be trigerred in 2 ways:
          1) draw any line and wait till the ball hits the line.
	  2) Randomly try to draw lines untill the ball hits one of the lines drawn

	Path:
		Start->*click 'New Game'->[Try to draw line on the screen] or [follow one of the steps listed above]

	A3T:
		A3T will not be able to expose the use of permissions as the application spawned new windows.
		and drawing line requires gestures which is not supported by the A3T now.
