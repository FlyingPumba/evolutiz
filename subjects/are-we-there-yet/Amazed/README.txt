History: 
When I was younger I received a strange wooden box containing a labyrinth as a present.  The aim was to navigate a marble through the labyrinth by tilting it in various directions.  Needless to say I was quickly addicted.  I wanted to build a  similar style game using the Accelerometer provided by Android.

TODO:
* Support landscape mode.
* Fastest time high score table.
* Improve the graphics, especially the game over and complete screens.
