<p>SyncMyPix is a free, open-source Android application developed and supported 
in whatever spare time I can seem to find. I hope that you have found this application useful, 
and I hope that developers can benefit from the source code.</p>

<p>SyncMyPix will always be free and open-source. However, if you would like to buy a sleep deprived
developer a coffee or two to help with the long hours of programming, consider making a donation. 
Donating does not serve as payment for services or features provided by myself or SyncMyPix. SyncMyPix 
will always be free for you to use whether you donate or not. Thank you for downloading and using SyncMyPix.</p>
