Jealous of your friends' with phones that allow contact pictures to sync with 
their favorite social networking sites? Now, with SyncMyPix, you can get your
Android based phone in sync with all of your friends.

Currently only Facebook is supported. If you're visiting from an Android phone,
you can get the app here: http://market.android.com/search?q=SyncMyPix

Here's a run down of the features currently implemented:

    * Sync your phone's contacts with your Facebook friends' profile pictures
    * If do not want to overwrite manually set contact pictures on your phone,
      the 'Skip existing pictures' option will let you do that
    * Option for only syncing contacts with phone numbers
    * Option for 'Smart name matching'  
    * Sync runs in the background leaving you free to do other tasks by 
      pressing HOME
    * View the results of the last sync operation 
    * Manual conflict resolution in the "Results" screen where a long press
      on a friend allows the picture to be manually added to a contact
    * Easily Extensible to support more social networking sites as picture 
      sources
